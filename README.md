# Hospital Management And Record Sharing(HMARS)
It is a web based project with some basic hospital management functionalities and a special functionality to share your report with other registered users. This project was made during my internship with Future Ready Talent.
There are three types of users in my project: 1. Patients     2. Doctors      3. Hospital Admin
I have used HTML, CSS, JS, NodeJS and MongoDB. The web site is hosted using Azure Web App Service and Database is on Azure Cosmos For MongoDB API.
